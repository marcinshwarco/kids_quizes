# Quizzes for kids
This is a child friendly quiz application that allows children to guess multiple times before submitting the correct answer. 
The quiz is designed to minimise child's frustration, so children can keep guessing until their answer is correct. 


The JavaScript quiz engine is included in every quizpage and the questions/clues for a particular quiz are stored in separate js. files as arrays.
